Materials you'll need:
Wooden body, we used a laser cutting machine to cut the body from a wooden panel; design files will be uploaded in github.
Designed PCB, the eagle files will be uploaded in github, realized by Eurocircuits.
2 10 kOhm resistors, which work as a partitioner for the photoresistors;
3 220 Ohm resistors, which limit the current in the led;
1 Buzzer;
1 Ultrasound Module;
1 10uF capacitor, in order to filter noise on servo;
1 128x64 Oled display;
1 RGB led;
2 photoresistors;
1 strip of male pins in order to attach the Arduino to the back of the PCB.

For the cabling step, you may buy a ready to use kit, or crimp on your own as we did.
if you want to crimp the cables on you own you may need
1 16 Way Unscreened Flat Ribbon Cable like the following http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/flat-ribbon-cable/0360116/
1 Connector Shrouded Header 16 Position 2.54mm Solder Straight Thru-Hole part no:753521 manufacturer:AMP/TYCO ELECTRONICS manufacturer no:5103308-5
1 2 Rows 16 Position wire housing Part no.: 901722 Manufacturer: AMP/TYCO ELECTRONICS Manufacturer no.: 1658622-3
1 pin crimping tool
1 pcs KF2510-3P 2.54mm Pin Header+Terminal+Housing Connector Kits
you'll exactly need for one Robottino 16 terminals and 4-4pins housing connectors, you dont need pin header since, housing connector can be directly connected to each module.
